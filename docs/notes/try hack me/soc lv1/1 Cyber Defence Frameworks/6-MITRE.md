> CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations, but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL)

## ENGAGE  

>  MITRE Engage  is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals.

With  **Cyber Denial**  we prevent the adversary's ability to conduct their operations and with  **Cyber Deception**  we intentionally plant artifacts to mislead the adversary. 


- Prepare: the set of operational actions that will lead to your desired outcome (input)
- Expose: adversaries when they trigger your deployed deception activities 
- Affect: adversaries by performing actions that will have a negative impact on their operations
- Elicit: information by observing the adversary and learn more about their modus operandi (TTPs)
- Understand: the outcomes of the operational actions (output)
